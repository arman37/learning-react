## :hash: Why React:
:arrow_right: ReactJS allows developers to break down the complex UI into simpler components and reuse the codes to complete their projects faster. <br />
:arrow_right: React is very a simple and lightweight library that only deals with the view layer. <br />
:arrow_right: React provides such a beautiful declarative API which enables developers to declaratively describe their User Interfaces and model the state of those interfaces. <br />
:arrow_right: React is just JavaScript. When writing code in ReactJS we don‚Äôt have to do that much react-ish things at all. There is a very small API to learn, just a few functions and how to use them. <br />
:arrow_right: It is quite un-opinionated, so we are free to choose the tools and technologies we prefer to use with it. <br />
:arrow_right: React has Unidirectional/One directional data flow, so data changes is more predictable and easy to debug. <br />
:arrow_right: React components can be easily reused. <br />
:arrow_right: Components can easily get unit-tested so by definition we can deliver well-structured, more safe and robust code. <br />
:arrow_right: With React we can reduce coupling and increase cohesion. <br />
:arrow_right: Components are the future of web development. <br />
:arrow_right: React is SEO-friendly. <br />
:arrow_right: React support server side rendering (SSR). <br />
:arrow_right: React uses Virtual DOM that makes the app really fast. <br />
:arrow_right: React is Fast when it comes to displaying a big amount of components. <br />
:arrow_right: Debugging is getting much easy with specialized Chrome extension. <br />
:arrow_right: React is maintained by Facebook and Instagram but also has a great open-source community. The brains behind Facebook are maintaining this project. <br />

## :hash: Container/Smart Component:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Concerned with how things work. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Takes care of  data fetching and state changing concerns. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Renders its corresponding sub-component. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Fetching data and presenting it in the same container reduces re-usability. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Usually doesn‚Äôt have any DOM markup of its own except for some wrapping divs, and never should have any styles. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Tends to serve as data sources. <br />

## :hash: Presentational/Dumb Component:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Concerned with how things look. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Takes care of only rendering concern. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Works as a simple JS function. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Reusable, testable. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Follows single responsibility principle. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Has no dependencies on the rest of the app. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Don‚Äôt specify how the data is loaded or mutated. <br />
