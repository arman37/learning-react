## :hash: Why React:
* React allows developers to break down the complex UI into **simpler components** and reuse the codes to complete their projects faster. <br />
* React is very a **simple** and **lightweight** library that only deals with the **view layer**. <br />
* React provides such a beautiful **declarative API** which enables developers to declaratively describe their User Interfaces and model the state of those interfaces. <br />
* React is just JavaScript. When writing code in React we don‚Äôt have to do that much react-ish things at all. There is a very small API to learn, just a few functions and how to use them. <br />
* It is quite **un-opinionated**, so we are free to choose the tools and technologies we prefer to use with it. <br />
* React has **Unidirectional**/**One directional** data flow, so data changes is more predictable and easy to debug. <br />
* React components can easily be **reused**. <br />
* Components can easily get unit-tested so by definition we can deliver well-structured, more safe and robust code. <br />
* With React we can **reduce coupling** and **increase cohesion**. <br />
* Components are the future of web development. <br />
* React is SEO-friendly. <br />
* React support server side rendering (**SSR**). <br />
* React uses **Virtual DOM** that makes the app really fast. <br />
* React is Fast when it comes to displaying a big amount of components. <br />
* Debugging is getting much easy with specialized Chrome extension. <br />
* React is maintained by Facebook and Instagram but also has a great open-source community. The brains behind Facebook are maintaining this project. <br />

## :hash: Basics:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: React works like a **Javascript engine for UI rendering**(like other Javascript engines used for game development). <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: React is used for **composable user interface** using JS & XML. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: In React app everything is made of **components**. Components are **self contained**, **concern-speific** building blocks(easy to reuse, extend & maintain). <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: A React component is simply a JavaScript class with a render method that returns a description of the components UI.<br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: React components lead to a **separation of concerns** not technologies. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: React's components are written in plain JavaScript. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: In React app 'Virtual DOM' is an in-memory, lighweight representation of the real DOM. <br />

## :hash: States:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: State is a plain JavaScript object which is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).<br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: React's components can have mutable data inside `this.state`. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: `this.state` is private to the component and can be changed by calling `this.setState()` method. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: When the state is updated, the component triggers the reactive rendering, and the component itself and its children will be re-rendered. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Calls to `this.setState` are asynchronous. This ensures, for example, that if both Parent and Child call `setState` during a click event, Child isn‚Äôt  re-rendered twice.<br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: `setState` calls are batched, Pass an updater function instead of an object if you need to compute values based on the current state.<br />

## :hash: Props:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Props are plain JavaScript objects which get passed to the component (similar to function parameters). <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Props plays as an key factor in data flow from parent to child components. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Props are passed and owned by the parent component. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: props can't be changed from inside the child component. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: props are provided as tag attributes much like in HTML. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: props are received by the component and are **immutable**. <br />

## :hash: Container/Smart Component:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Concerned with how things work. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Takes care of  data fetching and state changing concerns. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Renders its corresponding sub-component. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Fetching data and presenting it in the same container reduces re-usability. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Usually doesn‚Äôt have any DOM markup of its own except for some wrapping divs, and never should have any styles. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Tends to serve as data sources. <br />

## :hash: Presentational/Dumb Component:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Concerned with how things look. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Takes care of only rendering concern. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Works as a simple JS function. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Reusable, testable. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Follows single responsibility principle. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Has no dependencies on the rest of the app. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Don‚Äôt specify how the data is loaded or mutated. <br />

## :hash: Component Lifecycle:
![lifecycle](/images/component-lifecycle.jpeg)

## :hash: Defining Component Hierarchy:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Components should be small & have a **single concern**. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: A component should ideally only do one thing well. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: If a component ends up growing, it should be broken into smaller subcomponents. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Analyse the project's wireframes and layout when designing component hierarchy. <br />
